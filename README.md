This repository contains the code associated to "A spctrum of routing strategies for brain networks", currently under pre-print at PLoS Computational Biology.


Dependencies: this code requires you to have the latest version of the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT) in your Matlab path. You can download the BCT from [HERE](https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/ "Go to BCT download")

To add all functions to your path in Matlab, use the following command:
```>addpath(genpath(fullpath/toBCT))```

You may download the data used to do the analysis from [figshare](https://figshare.com/s/0d6ff1ce81f4268af5ed "go to figshare")
